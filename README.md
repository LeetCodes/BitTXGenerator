Generate fake Bitcoin transactions and broadcast them to the Bitcoin network.

Newest Version: 1.2.1

Updates (24/09/2016):

Fixed several connection error bugs.
Fixed a bug where sometimes it wouldn't succesfully validate the transaction while boradcasting.
Added the option to use Combined output overflow in the generated TX.

For those of you that do not know about the program, BitTXGenerator generates false Bitcoin transactions using a valid Sending and Receiving address and a satoshi amount (one satoshi = one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin.)

The transaction will validate for one block (about 10 minutes) and then will get a "Negative Confirmation" a short time after the next block.

The transaction will appear on the blockchain and all the Bitcoin clients as a normal Bitcoin transaction until it gets a negative confirmation.


I'm open to any input/suggestions for the next version. Also if you're having any trouble using the program, please contact me.
